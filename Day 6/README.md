# Day 6 â€“ Data Cleaning and Filtering with Pandas
This project focuses on cleaning and filtering messy data using Python and Pandas.  
It simulates real-world tasks like removing nulls, dropping duplicates, and filtering based on conditions.

##  What I Did:
- Removed missing values using `.dropna()`
- Removed duplicate entries using `.drop_duplicates()`
- Filtered rows by region (e.g., "East") and by sales amount
- Sorted rows based on sales in descending order

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab

## Key Learnings:
- How to clean and prepare raw data
- How to filter rows using conditions
- How to sort data to analyze performance

## File Summary:
- `data_cleaning_day6.ipynb`: Colab notebook with all code
- `data_cleaning_day6.py`: Converted Python script

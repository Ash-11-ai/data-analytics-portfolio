# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio – Ashutosh Mishra

Hi! I'm Ashutosh, a B.Sc. Zoology student (2024–2027) at Delhi University and a self-taught Data Analytics enthusiast.  
Over the past few weeks, I completed a self-guided bootcamp covering Python, Pandas, Excel, SQL, and Power BI — building real projects using real datasets.
I’m now actively looking for a paid internship to apply and grow my data skills.
